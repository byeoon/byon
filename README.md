# Configuration
* Install all dependencies beforehand: 
```bash
npm install
```
* Create a .env file in the project folder. Example of .env file:
```env
CLIENT_TOKEN=ABCDEFGH
```

# Deploying
On dev environment:
```bash
npm run dev
```
On production (immediately runs from dist, assuming everything has been compiled beforehand)
```bash
npm run start
```
